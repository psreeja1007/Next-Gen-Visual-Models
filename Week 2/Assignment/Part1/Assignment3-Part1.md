* Make a CNN architecture and train it for CIFAR100 classification
> Architecture should not be exactly same as of existing famous architectures like : LeNet-5, Alexnet etc. You can make your own inspired from them.
> **If it takes time in training, you can use free GPU available on google colab and if GPU units get exausted on you one google accoount, you can use anohter google account for training :)**
* Plot necessary graphs related to training model
  

## Description of Assignment:
Utilized the **CIFAR100** dataset and implemented a **CNN**
Performed **data augmentation** during preprocessing.
Employed **categorical_crossentropy** loss function for multiclass classification.
Achieved an accuracy of **0.39** due to a **limited number of epochs and a less complex network.**
Plotted graphs for training and validation accuracy, as well as training and validation loss versus epochs.
