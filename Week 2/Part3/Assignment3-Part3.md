# Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Rays using CNN (TensorFlow/Keras)

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify chest X-ray images into two categories: **Pneumonia** and **Normal**. It uses TensorFlow and Keras, along with data augmentation and regularization techniques, to improve generalization and prevent overfitting.


## ðŸ©» Dataset

The dataset contains grayscale chest X-ray images and is divided into two classes:

- **NORMAL**: Images of healthy lungs.
- **PNEUMONIA**: Images showing pneumonia-infected lungs.

The folder structure follows:

data/
â”œâ”€â”€ train/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ NORMAL/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ PNEUMONIA/
â”œâ”€â”€ test/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ NORMAL/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ PNEUMONIA/


## ðŸ§  Model Overview

The model is a custom CNN architecture built from scratch, consisting of:

- Multiple convolutional blocks with increasing filter sizes: 32, 64, 128, 256.
- Each block includes Batch Normalization, LeakyReLU activation, and Max Pooling.
- Flattening followed by a fully connected Dense layer of 512 units.
- Dropout regularization (rate = 0.5) to reduce overfitting.
- Final Dense layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification.


## ðŸ“ˆ Training Strategy

- **Data Augmentation**: Applied to the training set to introduce variations:
  - Rescaling
  - Shear transformations
  - Zooming
  - Horizontal flipping

- **Regularization Techniques**:
  - Batch Normalization after every convolutional layer
  - Dropout in the fully connected layer
  - LeakyReLU activations for better gradient flow

- **Optimization**:
  - Adam optimizer with a learning rate of `1e-4`
  - Binary crossentropy as the loss function
  - EarlyStopping and ReduceLROnPlateau callbacks for adaptive learning


## âœ… Results

- **Final Test Accuracy**: **84.13%**
- The model demonstrates good generalization on unseen validation data and can serve as a baseline for medical image diagnosis tasks.
